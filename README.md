# algorithm-designs-with-generative-ai
This project aims to develop an Algorithm Generation Framework (AGF) that can automatically generate efficient algorithms for a variety of computational tasks. The AGF will leverage the power of generative AI techniques to explore the vast space of possible algorithm designs and identify the best algorithms for specific tasks.
